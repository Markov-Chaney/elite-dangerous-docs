### Game-breaking
I've used this phrase because the forum uses this phrase; usually they only break one part of one gameloop.

# Ongoing troubleshooting

Freeform notes tracking forum discussions, theories, people trying things out...

## [69518](https://issues.frontierstore.net/issue-detail/69158) (Exploration/Cartography) on one page:
### In-depth
 - Assignment to sell in Liu Bajara / Fortified
 - Data from "around Ngurii" including 3 ELWs, 7m credits
 - Did not produce merits in Silva Terminal
 - DID produce credits in Cmdr's own FC
### Other confirmations
 - 3m+ of cartography data at Olokulu and received no merits
 - Sietynas (Kaine Fortified Region) - Sold 500k worth of data and got no merits. Powerplay map indicates "hand in cartography data" is a local activity. Worked before last set of patches!
 - Another user confirms it stopped working after the patch
