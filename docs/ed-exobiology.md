## Basic equipment 

This is in the recommended order for your first expedition.
| Kit | Mount | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Comp Scanner | Ship, SRV | This is pre-equipped on every ship and SRV. You can use it from the ship and the SRV **when you have it in a Fire Group**. Make sure you cycle through to that Fire Group. The reticule will "twitch" when it crosses something you can scan, which means you don't have to fly or drive with your finger on a trigger; but the trigger will then launch the full scan you need to get your find into the Codex and any of the First payouts. |
| Night Vision | Ship, SRV, Suit | This can help by just providing a different perspective to spot subtle clues, for instance, a dark patch which *doesn't* get a green outline is likely to be a bacteria colony rather than a dark rock. |
| Your wits | The ship needs to not fly into mountains. The suit needs to not run out of energy. The SRV needs to not run out of fuel. You need to be able to see so think about sunrise and sunset. If you leave your SRV somewhere and your ship somewhere else you'll need to recall the ship AND then go and get the SRV. |

## Tips

## Gotchas
The Comp Scanner and the Maverick suit's sampler serve different purposes and send different data back to the ship and the Codex. Make sure you Comp-Scan anything you think is relevant to Codex or to a First. The suit's sampler is the tool for Vista Genomics to pay out on the sample itself and doesn't log all that stuff relevant to your career, Commander. |
